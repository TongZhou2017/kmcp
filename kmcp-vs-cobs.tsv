Algorithm	K-mer hashing	xxhash	ntHash1	xxHash is a general-purpose hashing function while ntHash is a recursive hash function for DNA/RNA
	Bloom filter hashing	xxhash	Using k-mer hash values	Avoid hash computation
	Multiple-hash functions	xxhash with different seeds	Generating multiple values from a single one	Avoid hash computation
	Single-hash function	Same as multiple-hash functions	Separated workflow	Reducing loops
	AND step	Serial bitwise AND	Vectorised bitwise AND	Bitwise AND for >1 hash functions
	PLUS step	Serial bit-unpacking	Vectorised positional popcount with pospop	Counting from bit-packed data
Index structure	Size of blocks	/	Using extra thresholds to split the last block with the most k-mers	Uneven genome size distribution would make bloom filters of the last block extremely huge
	Index files	Concatenated	Independent	
	Index loading	mmap, loading complete index into RAM	mmap, loading complete index into RAM, seek	Index loading modes
Input/output	Input files	FASTA/Q, McCortex, text	FASTA/Q	
	Output	Target and matched k-mers	Target, matched k-mers, query FPR, etc.
